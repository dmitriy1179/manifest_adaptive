        <p>Who is your user? Indicate her KEY personality traits and help round out her overall image.</p>
        <p>Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test.
          According
          to
          the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions from this
          online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what the
          sliders
          mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.</p>

        <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.</p>
        <p>I list out Personallya jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the
          parallels later). , I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time
          perfection
          isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For each of those
          screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump
          around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.</p>
